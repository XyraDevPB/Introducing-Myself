# Introducing-Myself
Hi, I'm Xyra!

I'm 17 years old.

I'm a Turkish user who has been modding Brawl Stars for 2 years.

In this Github Account I have tutorial videos for your modding,

Adding Brawler [I haven't learned how to do it myself from scratch yet. I can only do it by pasting someone else's ported brawler files for now :( ]

Range Width and Length,

Change Brawlers Skills,

Start a Self Host Server,

And More...

Warning: When I share projects that do not belong to me but belong to someone else, I add them with the person who made them and their contact addresses. [If you do it this way, you will both respect someone else's work, and since you will not be copyrighted, his and your Github accounts will be recognized and used :D .]

Have A Nice Day...
